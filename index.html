    <h1 id="heading">What is jQuery?</h1>

    <p>
        jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library. It gives developers 
        lots of useful functions so they can make their webpage interactive across multiple browsers.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
        jQuery is an open source library with a big community of contributors.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Why should you learn jQuery?</h1>

    <p>
        If you learn jQuery, you'll be able to use it in your own webpages, understand other developer's webpages, 
        and have a better understanding generally about how to use libraries.
    </p>
    
    <p class="note">
        Note: jQuery functions use the DOM API (like <code>document.getElementById</code>).
        You should  learn that first, if you haven't yet.
    </p>
